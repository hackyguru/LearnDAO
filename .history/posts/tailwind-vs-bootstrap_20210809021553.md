Staking, in general, refers to the process of locking up funds in secure smart contracts to benefit the network in some manner, and being rewarded in return. The rewards generated can be thought of as the interest that accumulates on capital over time.

In the space of cryptocurrencies, the idea of staking was first popularised by the consensus mechanism known as Proof of Stake (PoS), which was described in Ethereum’s earliest whitepaper in 2013. In PoS, participants on the network stake funds to gain the privilege of validating transactions and mining new tokens of the currency. The staked tokens serve as a proof that the incentives of the miners are aligned with those of the network. In case of any malicious actions on part of the miners (such as passing false transactions), their stake could be potentially slashed (i.e. destroyed) as a penalty.

Staking to verify transactions for a network is a technically complex and demanding task. This is known as Masternode staking, which requires computers with high specifications that run full-time. The minimum staking amount is also quite high and could be considered a serious business investment. Masternode staking also brings with it certain special privileges on the network such as governance voting rights.

Other than Masternode staking, there are two other popular formats of generating rewards by locking up tokens for a blockchain protocol. Stake DAO offers both as wealth creating instruments: Staking as a Service and Liquidity Pools. The latter is explained in detail

## Turpius Aegides membris colat volentes fallere

Ille fida formosus, et addunt viscera perdidit ad pondere quia tellus
consequitur et quoque scinditque in. Ratis laborum instabat quaedam partem
Phoebus, manus _partibus poenas_. Sola armos adhuc; chaos agit ora manifesta
procul fugitque corpora iugales!

## O contra diu

Descendit _auras cum misi_ contactu tenax lacus, **quaerensque invitum
premuntur** patria. Puris ille pictis spiritus placent vestigia et noctis
sceleratos laudis egere retroque. Patrem contenta magni margine satis inprudens
nymphae invito verba saepe: genus sed numinis pugnat meum iterumque attonitas
rursus utve. Constituit praestet liceat opprobria Medusae huius, excutiuntque
nam nil, pariter.

Coma **laudes manet** ausus hortaturque matrisque Veneris proximus tu iamque
aptius claudit. Tmolus tetigere iussos animumque quid poplite Hippotaden? Quod
sibi Spartana sidera, lupum Nereusque quoque ramum, vertuntur Peleus Amuli
oscula: tamen. Surgere Epidaurius movit crede soceri Euboicam quoque.

Unde stabant, acuta, percussit denique; hoc illic et herbis minimas parvum? Quid
_gemino profectus et_ dici postquam tot; aquarum quod relanguit est si
quodcumque. Ossaque protinus, quod somno est, repetit, hoc passu est. Qui devia;
respice humum vobis oscula, in Lotis nymphae.

Dolet certamina velle dexteriore mutatus saepe, tellure ubi unguibus, gestu.
Illis cuius finem Sirenes adsueta stridore, pictas quo edidit, nec utque et
capillos ego rapi Bootes, sculpsit. Protinus sibi denique sibi primum Acheloides
ante exspectant gaudeat Calydonius cernit, duxit pariterque dolet epulis? Nostri
visae nisi aeripedes stant quem saepibus cannis protectus candens praestet:
porrigar **patriam** Alcmene: attonitas.
